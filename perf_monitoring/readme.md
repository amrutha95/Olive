## Extracting best models

-The file named testtt.ipynb is a place holder file to test and see the structure of my outputs so i could write my script
-The file named best_models.py is the script that extracts the best models from the output of the script and compared with the metrics of the original model, if the metrics of the best model is better than the original model, the best model is saved in a json named best_metrics.json.
-I added a function called extract best models in my utils file to extract the best models from the output of the script and compared with the metrics of the original model, if the metrics of the best model is better than the original model, the best model is saved in a json named best_metrics.json.
### How to run the script
Use pytest -s -v to run the script with the script name.
